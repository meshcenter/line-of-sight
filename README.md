# Line of Sight

![Screenshot of a web browser running the line of sight tool. The searched address is 31 Oliver Street and there are six lines of sight to nearby nodes shown on a map.](/image.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

This tool uses the [NYC 3D Building Model](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/3d-building.page) to check if a building has line of sight to nearby nodes. The data is from 2014, so results are not 100% accurate.
